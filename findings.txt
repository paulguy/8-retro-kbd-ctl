On an invalid packet (or at least wrong report ID?):
HID Report In 84: ((([E4 09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00])))

reports 177/178 in/out - information and firmware updating
usually starts with AA 55, except when AA 56
next value seems to be a length
then next value seems to be flags or something
then some kind of sequence number that's not always incremented and separate
 for send and receive
then data
responses to 55 seem to be with A3 followed by the sequence number

reports 84/82 "R"/"T" in/out - some kind of raw status and programming?
seems to start with some kind of request or command with response starting
with the same byte, but not always
